        <h2 id="heading5">5. Accessing your Bonus Bet</h2>
        <p><strong>5.1.</strong> If you have received a Bonus Bet, the Bonus Bet will be visible in your Account under
            "Bonus Bets". &nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>5.2.</strong> To redeem the Bonus Bet, when logged into your Account, you must select ‘Bonus Bet’
            from within the bet slip before placing your bet or, if available under the terms of the Offer, call

        <h2 id="heading6">6. Conditions of use</h2>
        <p><strong>6.1.</strong> If you are logged in to the Website, and a market has the "Bonus Bet" drop down menu
            available on the betting slip, the Bonus Bet can be placed on that market. Sports and events may have
            restrictions preventing you from placing two wagers including the Bonus Bet on the same bet market.</p>
        <p><strong>6.2.</strong> The Bonus Bet must be used within 7 days from the time that it is credited to your
            Account unless otherwise stated in the offer T&amp;C's.</p>

            Sportsbet.&nbsp;</p>
        <h2 id="heading7">7. Accessing your winnings from Bonus Bets</h2>
        <p><strong>7.1.</strong> Should your Bonus Bet be successful, only the winnings from the Bonus Bet will be
            credited into your Account.&nbsp; This means that your winnings will exclude the initial Bonus Bet
            stake.&nbsp; For example, a winning $50 Bonus Bet placed on a selection paying $3.00 will credit winnings of
            $100 into your Account.&nbsp; The $50 Bonus Bet stake will not be returned.</p>
        <h2 id="heading8">8. Other conditions</h2>
